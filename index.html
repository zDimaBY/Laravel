          <p>
            Hi, I'm a beginner backend developer, I'm 23 years old, I'm from
            Ukraine, the city of Khmelnitsky. Where I studied and trained as a
            CMS developer with Web-systems Solutions. I have been interested in
            programming since ~ 16 years old, like a hobi, when I was in the
            mood and, at my discretion, over all these years, the most
            informative were 3 months in the company compared to educational
            institutions, for example. In addition to web programming, I am also
            involved in programming microcontrollers (stm, atmega), programming
            radio-controlled aircraft, drones, ships.
